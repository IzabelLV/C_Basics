What This Repository Covers:
- Basics of C programming (syntax, functions, memory management, etc.)
- Hands-on coding experience through a small project

C is a powerful, general-purpose language. It may seem limited compared to C++, but it remains a fundamental and highly efficient language, especially for embedded development.
Had a lot of fun learning! Spent two days reading and coding!
